# Password Validation Checker

A simple web-based application to validate password strength using JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Provides the HTML structure for the interface.
- **script.js**: Contains JavaScript functions to validate password criteria, such as length, special characters, and uppercase letters.
- **style.css**: Adds styling to the user interface for a clean, modern look.

## Features

- Real-time validation of password requirements.
- Instant feedback for users on password strength.
- Lightweight and responsive design.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start using the password validation checker.

## How It Works

The JavaScript logic in `script.js` validates the password based on certain rules:
- Minimum length
- Presence of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Presence of special characters
- Use of numbers

As the user types, the interface provides feedback on each requirement.

## Technologies Used
